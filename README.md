## Project: Robotic Controllers
Problem Statement:

The problem we are going to slove is designing a robotic controller that can use the sensors to walk through the maze and arrive the destination without crashing into the wall. The robot has six different direction sensors, three on the front, one on the left, one on the right and one on the back. The robot can take four actions: move one-step foward, turn left, turn right, or stay. Each route can be one solution and can be scored, we can find the fittest solution by comparing the scores until it reaches the termination we set. The purpose of this project is not to train a robot to solve the maze, our purpose is to automatically program a robot controller with six sensors so the robot won't crash into the wall, and the maze in this case represent the complicated enviroment in the world.
